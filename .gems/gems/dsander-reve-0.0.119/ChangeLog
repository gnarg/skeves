  Added preliminary support for the ConqurableStation API, see 
    Reve::Clases::ConqurableStation class.
  Migrated subversion to a traditional trunk directory for my sanity. Expect
    future releases to also be in the tags directory.

Revision 21: 2007-08-28 02:45 (Tue, 28 Augu 2007)
  Changed all methods to require a Hash of parameters. Please refer to the
    documentation <http://docs.crudvision.com/reve/> for new method signatures,
    especially Reve::API main documentation.
  Add a protected method 'compute_hash' which every other public method calls, 
    using this new Hash parameter system, to construct a hash to represent the
    call uniquely. The result of this method should be suitable to store in a
    database so it can be used in conjunction with the cached_until variable.
    This hash is computed after each call and is available through the
    last_hash instance variable (like cached_until)
  Updated the test suite for these changes

  Add Reve::API.cached_until. Users of Reve PLEASE obey this setting! It will
    be set (overwritten) after each call and should be copied somewhere before
    another call is made.
  Change tester.rb to print the cached_until response for each test call.
  Change Reve::API#postfields to take a hash of post fields and change each
    Reve::API method accordingly.
